## Background information - Research it and write a summary about it
# In 1936, Ronald Fisher collected data on three species of the Iris flower which is referred as the Iris data set.
# However, it has also been referred to as Anderson's Iris data set as Edgar Anderson gathered the data. 
# The names of the three species selected were setosa, versicolor and virginica. 
# The data collected took measurements in centimeteres of the following features  - the length and width of the petals and also both the length and width of the sepals. 
# In total, 150 iris plants with 50 plants from each of the three species had these dimensions recorded.
# The Iris data set is described in statistics as a multivariate data set where there is more than one outcome to a variable.
# The purpose of the data set was to illustrate linear discrimiant analysis which displayed how the species difered from each other.
