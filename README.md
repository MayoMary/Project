## Background information:

### In 1936, Ronald Fisher collected data on three species of the Iris flower which is referred as the Iris data set. However, it has also been referred to as Anderson's Iris data set as Edgar Anderson gathered the data. The names of the three species selected were setosa, versicolor and virginica. The data collated was measurements in centimeteres of the following four features  - petal length and width and also sepal length and width resulting in the first line from the data set as follows : 5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa where Iris-setosa is the name of the species. In total, 150 iris plants with 50 plants from each of the three species had these dimensions recorded.  The Iris data set is described in statistics as a multivariate data set where there is more than one outcome to a variable. Based on the findings from the Iris data set, Fisher illustrated linear discrimiant analysis which displayed how the species differed from each other.

Dataset 

## Summarise data by max, min, mean of each column, use of pyton script.
### The minimum for the features was calculated using min.py python script giving the following results:
petal length 4.3, petal width 2.0, sepal length 1.0 and sepal width 0.1. 

### The maximum for the features was calculated using max.py python script giving the following results
petal length 7.9, petal width 4.4, sepal length 6.9 and sepal width 2.5.  

### The mean or average for the features was calculated using mean.py python script giving the following results
petal length 5.8, petal width 3.1, sepal length 3.8 and sepal width 1.2.
